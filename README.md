#####I added things that occurred to me, such as the form, I wanted to be able to add new people who happen to be on  their birtday, that is, that the user could do it, I couldn't do it, I have a lot to learn about React yet, however I could add the option of congratulate someone who had a birthday that day and also that the user could upload the photo of that person.
