[See the app here](https://manuel-morales-birtday-app.netlify.app/)
##### This is the first ptoject from John Smilga React Course on youtube what you can se [here](https://react-projects-1-birthday-reminder.netlify.app/)
##### I added things that occurred to me, such as the form, I wanted to be able to add new people who happen to be on  their birtday, I did that so that the user could add new birthday, in the original app you could only see those that were by default and deleting them, here you can add to the person you want.
